# Gennai API

Gennai is an API about the Digimon franchise. It was made on [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), using [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) and technologies such as [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/), [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/).

## Content
The goal of the Gennai API is to gather all the data about the Digimon franchise, that including games, series, movies, mangas, TCG, digimon and much more.

So far, this API only contains data from the Adventure universe (see below), but the main goal is to gather all data from every other universe. 

## Documentation
All the documentation about the Gennai API can be found [here](https://gennai-api.vercel.app/). As well as a playground for testing.

## Universe
Since many works of the franchise take place in different universes, a classification is being used to differentiate conflictual data. For example, the Adventure universe contains data from the series Digimon Adventure and Digimon Adventure Zero-Two, since both are connected and take place on the same universe, which is not the case of Digimon Tamers or Digimon Frontier.

For now, there is only 5 universes in totality, with only 1 (Adventure) working. See disponibility below:

## Future
This project is in early development stage, which means that a lot may change. From database structure to even switch to statically serve the data, but besides these core changes, somethings are already planned to be made in the future, such as:

- Finish the currently created universes;
- Website containing detailed documentation;
- Images (such as sprites, 3D prints, locations etc...);
- Internationalization;
- More universes (from games, mangas...).


## Contributing
Everyone can contribute to the project. Since it is in early stage, there's a lot to be done!
